## Interactive Chatbot and Debugger for Music Blocks

**Prerequisites**<br>
 - Experience with Python
 - Experience with Music Blocks
 - Experience with LLMs/Chatbots
 - Experience with AWS
 - Experience with FastAPI

**Description**<br>
The idea to enhance Music Blocks with a chatbot and project debugger. It must fulfill the gap between users' creative ideas and their 
ability to troubleshoot or fully utilize its features.
The chatbot could provide real-time assistance—answering questions, explaining features, and offering creative suggestions—while a project debugger helps users quickly identify and resolve issues in their project or blocks. This would make the platform more accessible, especially for beginners and streamlining the process for advanced users to debug and experiment with new features.
