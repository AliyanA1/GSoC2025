## Interactive Chatbot and Debugger for Music Blocks

**Prerequisites**<br>
 - Experience with Python
 - Experience with Music Blocks
 - Experience with LLMs/Chatbots
 - Experience with AWS
 - Experience with FastAPI

**Description**<br>
The idea to enhance Music Blocks with a chatbot and project debugger. It must fulfill the gap between users' creative ideas and their 
ability to troubleshoot or fully utilize its features.
The chatbot could provide real-time assistance—answering questions, explaining features, and offering creative suggestions—while a project debugger helps users quickly identify and resolve issues in their project or blocks. This would make the platform more accessible, especially for beginners and streamlining the process for advanced users to debug and experiment with new features.

## Image generation for lesson plans and model abstraction layer

**Prerequisites**<br>
 - Experience with Python
 - Experience with Music Blocks
 - Experience with LLMs/Chatbots
 - Experience with Fine tuning methods and RAG.

**Description**<br>
Develop and fine-tune an open-source language model to generate visually appealing and contextually accurate images for lesson plans, enhancing their usability and engagement. Leverage training datasets with annotated educational visuals for high-quality outputs. Also, Build a robust abstraction layer to make the AI system model-agnostic, allowing seamless integration of various models and ensuring flexibility and resilience in adapting to future advancements in AI.

Specifically, we would be working toward accomplishing the following:

- Train open source LLM to generate images for lesson plans.
- Implement model abstraction layer to make our AI system model agnostic and robust.
- Increase database size by including more lesson plans and projects' data to get better    response related to projects.
- Implement Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithms for faster retrieval.
- Develop FastApi endpoints to deploy the model on AWS.
- Work on techniques to minimize hellucination.
